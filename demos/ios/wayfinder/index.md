WayFinder is the product of a ContextHub hackathon we held at ChaiOne in March 2014. It uses bluetooth beacons to help newcomers to our Houston location get a tour of the office right on their device. Each time they reach a beacon, they get interesting facts about the company, or info about some of our more recent projects.

The reason we chose this project for the ContextHub hackathon is because normally this would be a pretty intense undertaking for a hackathon. However, thanks to the simplicity ContextHub provides, the WayFinder team was able to produce this fully functioning, beacon powered application in no time.
