# Notify Me

## Push Sample App

<div class="text-center">
  {% include notify-me_thumbs.html %}
</div>

Push notifications have long been a way to increase user engagement in your applications ever since they were introduced in iPhone OS 3.0 in 2009. However in 2013, iOS 7 brought a new level of functionality with background notifications which allow developers to send notifications that wake up their apps briefly to do additional processing that typically would have been done at first load. This makes apps feel more responsive to the user and enables a new class of applications that use push as a foundation to communicate with a user without a user's interaction.

Notify Me is the showcase sample app that introduces you to the push features of the ContextHub iOS SDK and developer portal. As a developer, you will learn how to register, send, and receive foreground and background push notifications to either devices, aliases, or tags in only a few lines of code. ContextHub takes care of translating each of those items to a push token which APNS needs to send the message to the correct device.
