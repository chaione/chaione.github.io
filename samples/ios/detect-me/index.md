In 2013 at WWDC with iOS 7, Apple introduced the world to iBeacons, low-power Bluetooth 4.0 devices that help to give contextual location information to smartphones in areas where GPS, WiFi, and cellular tower triangulation could not pinpoint a user's exact location. This is extraordinarliy helpful in indooor locations with profound impact in retail and commercial markets.

Detect Me is the showcase sample app that introduces you to the beacon features of the ContextHub iOS SDK and developer portal. As a developer, you will learn how to create, retrieve, update, and delete beacons as well as detect them and their proximity in only a few lines of code. ContextHub takes care of setting up and monitoring beacons to generate events that the server can listen and respond to and then save those events in a vault to be accessed later.

Grab the [source](https://github.com/contexthub/detect-me) off of GitHub, follow along, and start integrating beacons into your apps and make them contextually aware!
