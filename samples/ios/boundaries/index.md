Positional awareness is quickly going from a nifty feature to a must have. Users expect more out their devices each and every day with location being a prime example of a data point that's ready to be taken advantage of. Geofences allow your application to be notified when a device enters or exits an area of interest so you can provide relevant data to your users right when they need it.

Boundaries is the showcase sample app that introduces you to the geofences features of the ContextHub iOS SDK and developer portal. As a developer, you will learn how to create, retrieve, update, and delete geofences as well as handle events in only a few lines of code. ContextHub takes care of setting up and monitoring geofences to generate events that the server can listen and respond to and then save those events in a vault to be accessed later.

Grab the [source](https://github.com/contexthub/boundaries) off of GitHub, follow along, and start integrating geofences into your apps and make them contextually aware!
