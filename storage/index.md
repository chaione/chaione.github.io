Cloud storage of data can be difficult. When dealign with an ever expanding world of devices, keeping track of what's going in involves more than simply storing data on a single device for retrieval later. Especially with the coming "Internet of Things" revolution, maintaining state in your contextual apps allows you to build smarter rules that know not just what happened right now, but what happened 30 minutes or a day ago. So instead of asking "is my light on now?", we can save data saying "my light was on 5 minutes ago."

Storage is the showcase sample app that introduces you to the vault features of the ContextHub iOS SDK and developer portal. As a developer, you will learn how to create, retreive, update, and delete vault items in only a few lines of code. ContextHub allows you to store small amounts of data on the server which can be accessed by all devices without starting up your own database server.

Grab the [source](https://github.com/contexthub/storage) off of GitHub, follow along, and start integrating vault into your apps and make your apps more contextually aware!
