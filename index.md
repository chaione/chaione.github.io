# Overview

<p class="subtitle">Add event processing and analytical capabilities to your applications with just a few lines of code</p>

ContextHub provides a mechanism for third party developers to quickly and easily add powerful event processing capabilities to their applications with just a few lines of code. This enables developers to create unique and engaging experiences for their users.


### Getting Started
Using ContextHub is simple and straightforward:

1. **Sign Up** [Sign up for ContextHub](https://app.contexthub.com) and create your free account by either creating a username/password or using your [GitHub credentials](https://github.com/). This will give you access to the [Developer Portal](/docs/admin/), where you will be able to create and manage your apps.
2. **Create an App** On ContextHub, you create a separate app for each of your mobile or web applications. Each account on ContextHub can have multiple application ids for multiple apps. This lets you accommodate both testing and production versions of your app with the same account, or multiple apps.
3. **Create triggers** Once you have created an app, you'll want to use the [triggers](/docs/admin/#Triggers) area to create as many web endpoints as you need. Mobile devices, web apps and other servers will post events to these endpoints. Most simple applications use only one trigger.
4. **View your events** A few seconds after posting events to the trigger endpoints, you should see these events appearing in the Developer Portal. You can view detailed information about the latest events received in the [events](/docs/admin/#Events) area. You can also see basic reports and even extract the full event dataset in the [analytics](/docs/admin/#Analytics) area.
5. **Add rules** The [Rules Engine](/docs/contextualengine/) allows you to respond to contextual events by triggering custom snippets of JavaScript code. Use the [contexts](/docs/admin/#Contexts) area in the Developer Portal to create one or more Rules. 
6. **View logs** The [logs](/docs/admin/#Logs) are in the Developer Portal is useful as it can help you debug your rules and get a better understanding of any errors, webhook calls, etc.
