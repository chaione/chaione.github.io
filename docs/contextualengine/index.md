# Contextual Engine

The contextual engine is the center of ContextHub, adding dynamic capabilities to events generated by your apps through context rules. The contextual engine aims to solve the problem of allowing developers to change how their app behaves based on events generated by a device to create a more seamless experience for end users. Through events, feeds, and context rules, you'll be able to build more quickly modern, contextually-aware applications your users will enjoy.

Context rules are written in javascript. There are a few pre-existing objects that you can interact with when one of your context rules executes --


<a data-magellan-destination="beacon" name="beacon"></a>

## Beacon

Beacons are Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy devices that allow devices to detect proximity to objects within 50 meters. This gives you the ability to give context-sensitive information to your users in areas where GPS, WiFi, and cellular towers cannot pinpoint a user's exact location, such as deep inside buildings or underground. Here's how to use the *beacon* object to interact with beacons in a context rule:

### beacon properties

| Property  | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| uuid      | Generates a random uuid every time this propery is accessed. You should store the value of this property in a variable if you need to use the same uuid in multiple places. |

### beacon methods

| Method    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [create](#beacon-create)    | Creates a new beacon in ContextHub |
| [find](#beacon-find)      | Finds a beacon by id |
| [allTagged](#beacon-alltagged) | Finds beacons matching **all** of the given tags |
| [anyTagged](#beacon-anytagged) | Finds beacons matching **any** of the given tags |
| [update](#beacon-update)    | Updates an existing beacon with new information  |
| [destroy](#beacon-destroy)   | Deletes a beacon from the system |


<a name="beacon-create" data-magellan-destination="beacon-create"></a>

#### Create

Creating a beacon contextual element in ContextHub is simple. Every beacon has a UUID (32 digit hexadecimal character, a major value (ranging from 1-65535), and a minor value (also ranging from 1-65535). UUIDs you use should be unique so beacons from other user's do not interfere with your app. A combination of these three values should be unique for every beacon you have.

##### Syntax
`beacon.create(tags, name, uuid, major, minor)`

##### Parameter Values

| Parameter    | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| tags         | Required. A comma separated string of tags to associate with the beacon. If you don't want to tag the beacon, you can pass in null or "".|
| name         | Required. The name of the beacon |
| uuid         | Required. The uuid of the beacon. |
| major        | Optional. The major number for this beacon. |
| minor        | Optional. The minor number for this beacon. |

##### Return Value
The id of the newly created beacon.

<a name="push" data-magellan-destination="push"></a>

---

## Push

The *push* object allows you to send push notifications across all service platforms *(APNS & GCM)*. By sending notifications to devices with a certain tag, you can send a single notification to IOS and Android devices. Certain APNS keys (alert, badge, sound, category) will be duplicated in the GCM message payload to simplify sending similar messages to different platforms.

When sending notifications to multiple platforms, you need to be mindful of payload size limits:

* IOS 7.1 and lower: 256 bytes
* IOS 8.0 and above: 2048 bytes
* Android: 4096 bytes

### push methods

| Method    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [deliver](#push-deliver) | Sends a push notification to iOS *and/or* Android devices. |

<a name="push-deliver" data-magellan-destination="push-deliver"></a>

---

#### Deliver

Delivers a push notification to one or more devices. There a few ways to determine which devices will receive the notification: *push_tokens*, *device_ids*, *alias*, *tags*. You need to use at least one of those keys to successfully send a notification.

##### Syntax
`push.deliver(jsonString)`

##### Parameter Values

| Parameter  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| jsonString | Required. Stringified JSON of the push object to send. See the table below to see all the available options. |

| Key | Platform | Type | Description |
|-----|----------|------|-------------|
| push_tokens | APNS/GCM | Array | An array of APNS device tokens and/or GCM registration ids to send a notification to.|
| alias | APNS/GCM | Array | An array of device aliases to send a notification to. |
| device_ids | APNS/GCM | Array | An array device ids to send a notification to. This is the preferred way to send notifications to a single device.|
| tags | APNS/GCM | Array | An array of device tags to send a notification to. This is the preferred way to send notifications to multiple devices. |
| tag_operator | APNS/GCM | String | By default, tag matching will match on _ANY_ of the given tags. If you want to send notifications to devices that match _ALL_ of the given tags, set the tag_operator parameter to ALL. The default value is _ANY_. |
| exclude_device_ids | APNS/GCM | Array | Array of device ids that you want to exclude from delivering a message to. This is handy when sending notifications to tagged devices and want to exclude one or more devices from that group. |
| exclude_push_tokens | APNS/GCM | Array | Array of push tokens that you want to exclude from delivering a message to. This is handy when sending notifications to tagged devices and want to exclude one or more devices from that group. |
| mdm | APNS | String | APNS Mobile Device Management magic key. You most likely don’t want to use this. This is an APNS specific key. |
| priority | APNS | Integer | Sets the APNS priority. Can be either be set to 10 (immediate) or 5 (conserve power). This is an APNS specific key. Defaults to 10. |
| expiry | APNS/GCM | Integer | Identifies when a notification is no longer valid and can be discarded. APNS notifications default to one day. GCM notifications default to 4 weeks. |
| category | APNS | String | Sets the APNS category for push. This key will be added to the GCM data payload if it exists and the data payload does not already contain a category key. |
| url_args | APNS | String | Sets the url-args in the aps section of the APNS payload. This is an APNS specific key used for notifications to web browsers. |
| badge | APNS | Integer | The number to display as the badge of the app icon. If this property is absent, the badge is not changed. To remove the badge, set the value of this property to 0. This key will be added to the GCM data payload if it exists and the data payload does not already contain a badge key. |
| sound | APNS | String | The name of a sound file in the app bundle. The sound in this file is played as an alert. If the sound file doesn’t exist or default is specified as the value, the default alert sound is played. The audio must be in one of the audio data formats that are compatible with system sounds. This key will be added to the GCM data payload if it exists and the data payload does not already contain a sound key. |
| alert | APNS | String or Object | If this property is included, the system displays a standard alert. You may specify a string as the value of alert or a dictionary as its value. If you specify a string, it becomes the message text of an alert with two buttons: Close and View. If the user taps View, the app is launched. Alternatively, you can specify a dictionary as the value of alert. This key will be added to the GCM data payload if it exists and the data payload does not already contain a alert key. |
| content_available | APNS | Integer | Provide this key with a value of 1 to indicate that new content is available. Including this key and value means that when your app is launched in the background or resumed, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: is called. Newsstand apps are guaranteed to be able to receive at least one push with this key per 24-hour window. This is an APNS specific key. |
| collapse_key | GCM | String | A collapse key is an arbitrary string that is used to collapse a group of like messages when the device is offline, so that only the most recent message gets sent to the client. For example, *New mail*, *Updates available*, and so on. GCM allows a maximum of 4 different collapse keys to be used by the GCM server at any given time. If you exceed this number GCM will only keep 4 collapse keys, with no guarantees about which ones they will be. This is an GCM specific key. |
| data | APNS/GCM | Object | For APNS devices, this adds custom keys to the payload data. For GCM devices, this is the message payload. Any valid JSON is acceptable. GCM messages will have the ‘alert’, ‘badge’, ‘sound’, ‘category’ keys added to the payload if they have been set and the keys do not already exist in the payload. |

##### Return Value
Nothing.

<a name="events"></a>
<a data-magellan-destination="events"></a>

##EVENTS

Sensors in modern devices generate a lot of data which ContextHub packages today into an event. The event data structure contains keys about the event which you can use in context rules to create advanced processing on the ContextHub server. All events have a very basic structure with 6 important keys:

- `name` - The name of the event which will determine the context rule(s) to be executed
- `data` - The data from the event specific to the event type (pre-defined events have pre-defined structures, see below for more info)
    - `datetime` - Every pre-defined event will have an ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the event was triggered by the device.
- `context` - Context represents data about the device which generated the event
    - `device_context` - Basic data about the device: model, type, OS version, and device id
    - `geofence_context` - A list of geofences the device was last in when the event occurred
    - `location_context` - Basic location data about the device when the event occured
    - `ranged_beacons_context` - A list of specific beacons in range of the device when the event occured
- `payload` - Developer-defined custom data sent along with every event generated by the ContextHub SDK.
- `id` - A unique 32-hexadecimal character string displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, in standardized UUID/GUID format (`8-4-4-4-12`)
- `created_at` - An IOS 8601 timestamp created when the event was created on the server.

<a data-magellan-destination="events-sampleevent"></a>

###Sample Event

Here is the structure of a sample event:
{% gist CHLibrarian/18c01d70d2448bfec465 %}
<br />

<a name="events-beaconinout"></a>
<a data-magellan-destination="events-beaconinout"></a>


###Beacon In/Out

The `beacon_in`/`beacon_out` event is generated whenever a device enters or exits a beacon region. A beacon region is defined as a UUID + major/minor values, if provided. If not provided, then several beacons having the same UUID will only trigger a `beacon_in` event once. Inside the `data` key, there is a `beacon` key indicating the beacon region which was just entered/exited and the UUID for the beacon region. Major and minor values will be filled only if the monitored region in ContextHub has them (they are not required). To get events about specific beacons, specifically `state` and `accuracy` values, look at `beacon_changed`.

{% gist CHLibrarian/4124b79edcc0e6969f8d %}
<br />

<a name="events-beaconchanged"></a>
<a data-magellan-destination="events-beaconchanged"></a>

### Beacon Changed

The `beacon_changed` event is generated whenever a device changes proximity of a *specific* beacon. There are three pre-defined states, `immediate_state`, `near_state`, and `far_state` which are approximately 0-6 inches, 6-12 inches, and 12 inches - 50 feet depending on the range and power setting of the particular beacon used. Within the `beacon` key of the `data` key, you will find the specific `major` and `minor` values of the beacon, as well as the `rssi` value giving relative strength. Estimote explains very well [here](https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/201029223-RSSI-Range-Zones-and-Distance-Accuracy) RSSI values and how they relate to distance between a device an a beacon. `accuracy` is also another key present which gives the approximate distance from the beacon to the device. Given the number of factors that influence wireless signals in an area, the accuracy value should be used as a general guideline, and not relied on in critical scenarios.

###Geofence In/Out

The `geofence_in`/`geofence_out` is generated whenever a device enters or exists a circular geofence region. A geofence region is defined as a geospatial center with latitude and longitude, and radius in meters. Inside the `data` key, there is a `fence` key indicating the geofence region which was just entered/exited along with the latitude, longitude, and radius of the geofence. The `state` key determines whether the event was a `geofence_in` or `geofence_out` event.

###Location Changed

The `location_changed` event is generated whenever a device has a significant location change as defined by the platform. For iOS, this is approximately once every 1000 meters, depending on WiFi/cellular tower density and GPS availability. The `data` structure contains keys related to the `latitude`, `longitude`, `speed`, `altitude`, and `course` of the device at the time the event was generated.

###Motion Changed

The `motion_changed` event is generated whenever an iOS device with the M7 chip transitions between various states representing different modes of transportation: `stationary`, `walking`, `running`, and `driving`. The `data` key contains two keys (`current_activity` and `previous_activity`) representing the current and previous activities respectively along with a `start_date` timestamp and `confidence` key representing how confident the M7 is that the state of the activity is accurate.

### Tick

The `tick` event is a special event that is automatically executed once every minute in the ContextHub server. Using the JavaScript `Date()` object and checking the time, this allows you the ability to execute commands in ContextHub even with the *absence* of any events on the server. So instead of your server code simply being reactive to devices, it can be a proactive part of your applications.

###Custom Events

Custom events are events triggered by the developer that have no predefined data structure. These events are manually triggered by the SDK through a specific method, or by posting an event through a feed for web browsers, servers, JavaScript scripts, and IoT-like devices like the Raspberry Pi or Arduino. All custom events must have a defined `name` key, so they can be processed by the appropriate context rule if it exists and should have the `data` key representing your custom data structure. Custom events generated by non-SDK devices, will not have either the `context` or `payload` unless they are defined by you, the application developer.

Below is a sample of a data structure of a custom event, taken from the [Awareness](/samples/ios/awareness) context rule sample app.

##Triggers

Triggers are specially crafted, application-specific URLs generated by ContextHub that let you trigger your own custom events from any web browser, JavaScript script, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or other IoT device. Triggers are perfect for integrating new platforms not yet directly supported by our SDKs into your own applications.

###Creating

Creating a trigger is simple. In the developer portal, select an app, then click on *Settings*, then the *Triggers* tab to see all the triggers for you app. To create a new trigger, click the *New Trigger* button and type in a name of the trigger. A generated trigger looks like this:

`https://app.contexthub.com/api/triggers/:token/:event_name`

- `:token` - random alphanumeric string generated by ContextHub tying the events for the trigger directly to your app
    - Example: `1782914xneuuoy26b6g45swco`
- `:event_name` - name of the event which will match the context rule during rule processing
    - Example: `arduino_event`

So the full URL for a trigger linked to your app that would post the `arduino_event` would be:

`https://app.contexthub.com/api/triggers/1782914xneuuoy26b6g45swco/arduino_event`

###Posting

To use a trigger, you need to generate an HTTP POST request with the appropriate token and event name, along with posting the JSON body that represents the data for your event. The web request should have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json` so the body is parsed correctly. A web tool like [Hurl.it](http://www.hurl.it) is a great way to test that your triggers are working correctly and you are passing the correct data to a context rule.
