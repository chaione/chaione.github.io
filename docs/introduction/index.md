## Getting Started

### Registration
On ContextHub, you create a separate app for each of your mobile applications. Each app has its own application id which you will use to register with the ContextHub SDKs and API. Each account on ContextHub can have multiple application ids for multiple apps. This lets you accommodate both testing and production versions of your app with the same account.

### Sign Up
[Sign up for ContextHub](https://app.contexthub.com) by either creating a username/password or using your [GitHub credentials](https://github.com/).
