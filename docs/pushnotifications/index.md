# Push notifications

Push notifications lets you send foreground messages which your users will be alerted to as well as background notifications to send data to your app. The implementation of Push differs slightly between iOS and Android devices - please refer to the document set that is most appropriate to you:

 * [iOS Push Notifications](http://docs.contexthub.com/docs/ios/#PushNotifications)
 * [Android Push Notifications](http://docs.contexthub.com/docs/android/#PushNotifications)

You can also send Push Notifications to both iOS and Android devices using our [REST API](/contexthub-api).
