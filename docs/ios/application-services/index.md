#Application Services

## Services

Application services provides additional services in addition to element and event services to developers in ContextHub so they can write better and more integrated applications using our platform.


###Push Notifications

**[Push](/docs/ios/application-services/push)** allows for the sending of foreground and background notifications to devices and is handled by `CCHPush`. The service deals with registering for and handling push messages as well as sending messages to devices, aliases, or tags. By allowing for notifications to be sent based on different groups, you can abstract away some of the complexity of sending push messages to devices and focus more on the core logic of your application.

###Vault
**[Vault](/docs/ios/application-services/vault)** allows for simple key-value storage in ContextHub and is handled by `CCHVault`. The service deals with creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting vault items. Vault can be used to give state to events generated by devices and processed by context rules, so that rules can provide smarter intelligence in your application. A simple example of this is storing the timestamp of an event in vault so that the next time an event is triggered, you can have logic in a context rule that only sends a push notification to your device at most every 5 minutes.
