# Element Services

## Elements

Element services provide the ability to interact with basic elements in ContextHub (beacons and geofences) as well as subscribing to tags which generate events whenever elements are created, updated or deleted.

###Beacons
**[Beacons](/docs/ios/element-services/beacons)** are Bluetooth Low Energy micro-location devices recently introduced in iOS 7 and are handled by `CCHBeaconService`. The service deals with creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting beacon contextual elements. Integration beacons into your application allows to build new location experiences inside areas much smaller and out of reach compared to traditional location technologies like GPS, WiFi and cellular triangulation.

###Geofences
**[Geofences](/docs/ios/element-services/geofences)** are pre-defined areas of interest marked by a center and radius and are handled by `CCHGeofenceService`. The service deals with creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting geofence contextual elements. Geofences let your application be awared when a user enters or exits and area of interest so your application can respond to these events in a more dynamic and unique way.

###Subscriptions
**[Subscriptions](/docs/ios/element-services/subscriptions)** are the element notification system in ContextHub that is handled by `CCHSubscriptionService`. The service deals with background notifications whenever beacons, geofences, vault items and devices are created, updated or deleted. This lets your application be more responsive to actions generated by either by other devices or context rules so it can have the latest information in real-time to create a truly modern and responsive application for your users.
