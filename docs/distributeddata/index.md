# Distributed Data
{: #distributeddata}

Vault lets you save data to the server which all devices and context rules can access. Combined with element services, it allows beacons and geofences to have state. The implementation of Vault differs slightly between iOS and Android devices - please refer to the document set that is most appropriate to you:

 * [iOS Data Distribution](/docs/ios/#DataDistribution)
 * [Android Data Distribution](/docs/android/#DataDistribution)

You can also access Vault objects using our [REST API](/contexthub-api).
