<h2 id="contexts">CONTEXTS</h2>

<p>The contextual engine evaluates contextual rules written in JavaScript to respond to events triggered by devices and sensors to cause actions which happen on the ContextHub server which affect other devices. These actions include sending push notification, storing data in vault, sending and receiving http requests, and logging console data to your server logs. These actions happen through objects which have a set of methods available to you to create powerful contexts in your applications.</p>
