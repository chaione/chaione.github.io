        <p class="subhead">Build contextual capabilities into your applications with just one line of code</p>

        <p>
          ContextHub provides a mechanism for third party developers to quickly and easily add powerful contextual capabilities to their applications with just a few lines of code. This enables developers to create unique and engaging experiences for their users.
        </p>
        <p>
          ContextHub makes this possible through the following five major components:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Element Services.</strong> Enable the creation of contextual object abstractions in ContextHub. These can be elements like geofences, beacons, motion states, thermal or proximity ranges, etc.) so applications can monitor and respond to user interactions or changes with them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Event Services.</strong> Establish interfaces with mobile devices and other smart objects, to allow easy collection of sensor data <em>(GPS, motion, accelerometer, etc.)</em>. This allows their data and capabilities to become available not only locally, but remotely as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contextual Engine.</strong> Provides developers with a central, cloud-based rules engine that responds to contextual events, with a context-aware language that allows triggering customized actions based on an evaluation of relevant data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Application Services.</strong> Provide a set of convenient cloud-based services that facilitate development of contextual applications and reduce the need for developers to establish and manage a back-end scalable infrastructure of their own - for example, data storage <em>(Vault)</em> or push messaging <em>(Push)</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics Services.</strong> Provide a robust set of analytical capabilities for developers and administrators.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          ContextHub provides seamless integration across mobile phones and smart objects from different vendors (Apple iOS, Android, etc.), providing a unified interface to them. It also allows developers to create applications using higher-level abstractions that are not vendor or implementation-specific, allowing for new physical devices and capabilities to be added to an application without the need for any code changes or having to learn that particular device’s technical interaction considerations (API’s, SDK).
        </p>
        <p>
          The data, events and rules engine in ContextHub are available not only to mobile applications, but through a REST interface as well. This allows for easy integration of the contextual capabilities mentioned above with third party cloud-based applications.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="element-services">Element Services</h3>

        <p>
          Through Element Services, applications create and maintain contextual object abstractions in ContextHub. Each type of abstraction (geofences, beacons, timers, etc) has its own class, which defines specific methods for that particular object:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Geofences -</strong> allows the creation, retrieval, updating &amp; deletion of geofence objects - which are circular areas defined by a particular location with a radius around it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beacons -</strong> allows the creation, retrieval, updating &amp; deletion of beacon objects. Each beacon object represents a device that has iBeacon capabilities - for example an iOS device (iPhone, iPad) or smart beacons (Estimote, etc.)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To complement these, Element Services provides Subscription functionality, which is used to let ContextHub know that a particular application is interested in changes to the definition of one or more Elements. This way, an application can stay proactively updated when contextual objects are added, modified or deleted in ContextHub - without the need to perform frequent polling.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="event-services">Event Services</h3>

        <p>
          ContextHub provides a mechanism to sense and collect data from mobile devices and other smart objects. This allows physical objects to connect and interact with the logical contextual objects defined in Element Services. There are three ways of doing this:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Mobile phones and tablets -</strong> simply need to enable the Sensor Pipeline which is part of the ContextHub Framework, and subscribe it to one or more Elements. This subscription can be done through a convenient tagging mechanism to subscribe to one or more Elements at once.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="application-services">Application Services</h3>

        <p>
          ContextHub provides a set of application services that make developing contextual applications easier and in some cases enable developers to avoid having to create a robust, scalable back-end infrastructure at all. These services are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Vault -</strong> allows for easy storage and retrieval of user-defined data in the ContextHub cloud. This storage is application specific, and can contain JSON data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Push -</strong> allows devices to register and receive messages from ContextHub or other devices. This service is also required to enable the communication between the ContextHub Contextual Engine and the mobile application.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="contextual-engine">Contextual Engine</h3>

        <p>
        At the heart of ContextHub is the Contextual Engine. The contextual engine is accessed through the developer portal and allows the creation and management of Contexts:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Context - is a small computer program triggered by a contextual event that allows developers to evaluate a variety of factors so they can drive specific actions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The event that triggers a Context can be any event generated by Event Services - for example, crossing a geofence or approaching a beacon.
        </p>
        <p>
        The snippet of code is written in JavaScript, and ContextHub makes available to it the following JavaScript objects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Event -</strong> an object with information pertaining to the triggering event, local sensor data captured when the event happened and a user-defined payload.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Push -</strong> allows the developer to send push messages (foreground or background) to a specific device, alias or group of devices through the use of tags.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vault -</strong> allows the Context to store, retrieve, update and delete user-defined information in the ContextHub cloud. This is the same storage area that is accessed from the SDK through the Vault Application Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Web hook -</strong> a destination URL with customizable parameters and data that can be associated with a Context so it is triggered by the Context. This allows for Contexts to trigger other Contexts, or to reach out to any external system or device connected to the Internet. Of course, developers can customize the headers, verb type (post/get/etc), parameters and data that is sent.
          </li>
        </ul>

				<p>ContextHub provides a mechanism for third party developers to quickly and easily add powerful contextual capabilities to their applications with just a few lines of code. This enables developers to create unique and engaging experiences for their users.</p>
				<h3>Apps</h3>
				<p>On ContextHub, you create a separate app for each of your mobile applications. Each app has its own application id which you will use to register with the ContextHub iOS SDK. Each account on ContextHub can have multiple application ids for multiple apps. This lets you accommodate both testing and production versions of your app with the same account.</p>
				
				<h2 id="setup">Initial Setup</h2>
				<h3>Sign up</h3>
				<p>Sign up for ContextHub at <a href="http://www.contexthub.com">http://www.contexthub.com</a>.</p>
				<h3>Download</h3>
				<p>Download the framework from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/contexthub/contexthub-ios-framework">https://github.com/contexthub/contexthub-ios-framework</a> and add it to your project as well as include the necessary libraries (CoreLocation, CoreMotion, and MobileCoreServices)</p>
				
				<h2>Sample apps</h2>
				<p>Sample apps are available to walk you through the different services ContextHub offers. Below are the following sample apps to choose from. We recommend starting off with Hello ContextHub to get an idea of how to ContextHub works before looking into other examples</p>
				<p>Each sample app usually has a v1.0 with a simple concept dealing with only one elemental service. Successive versions of apps then integrate more services to create more interesting use cases</p>
				<h3>Samples</h3>
				<p><strong>Hello ContextHub</strong> - introduces you to the basic ideas behind ContextHub, the iOS SDK framework, and contextual engine. You'll see how events triggered on the device end up on the server and write rules to respond to events on ContextHub.</p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/contexthub/hello-contexthub">https://github.com/contexthub/hello-contexthub</a></p>
				<p><strong>WayFinder</strong> - iBeacons</p>
				<ul>
				<li>WayFinder v1.0 - Dives into how to detect and use iBeacons to develop a location-aware application. You'll be setting up a few iBeacons and can pretend you are right in the ChaiOne office!</li>
				<li>WayFinder v2.0 - Building off of WayFinder v1.0, you'll expand the scope of your app by storing data on the server and learn the concept of tags, a way to group similar elements together in ContextHub for easy retrieval from the server. (+ vault)</li>
				<li>WayFinder v3.0 - After WayFinder v2.0, it's time to integrate Apple Push Notification Services (also known as push notifications). You'll write a rule that will send a push notification each time a beacon has entered range and also send a push when the last beacon leaves range. (+ push)</li>

				<h2>Documentation</h2>
				<p>Reference documentation is available and is included in the same GitHub repository where the ContextHub iOS SDK is hosted. The docs are generated to integrate with Xcode for quick reference during development. All of the classes and their methods have parameter information listed for their intended use.</p>
				<p><a href="http://docs.contexthub.com/contexthub-ios-framework/">http://docs.contexthub.com/contexthub-ios-framework/</a></p>
				
				<h2>Services</h2>
				<p>ContextHub made up primarily of 5 different services: elements (geofences, beacons), events (subscriptions to tags), contexts, <em>application</em> (push, vault), and analytics.</p>

				<h2 id="element-services">Element Services</h2>
				<h4>Beacons</h4>
				<p><code>CCHBeaconService</code> allows you access to beacon information that lives on the ContextHub server. You have the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) beacons with an associated tag.</p>
				<p><strong>Creating</strong></p>
				<p>For example, let's say we wanted to create a beacon on the server with the tag "demo". Beacons have information such as UUID, major and minor To create a beacon, call:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/bddcc29fe2629ee425bc.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Retrieving</strong></p>
				<p>Retrieving a beacon to change it is also similarly easy. You can retrieve beacons by either id (unique) or by tag (array). Retrieving by id is as follows:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/d07b400c01bbca4de2e0.js"></script>
				<p>Retrieving by tag gives you an array of beacons:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/ae805f63833fec291937.js"></script>
        <p><strong>Updating</strong></p>
				<p>Updating a beacon is a single call:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/f8fcd1ee194525e5e8a4.js"></script>
        <p><strong>Deleting</strong></p>
				<p>Deleting a beacon is also similar:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/c9f108e5e7d97c0c9259.js"></script>
        <h4>Geofences</h4>
				<p>CCHGeofenceService allows you access to geofence information that lives on the ContextHub server. You have the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) geofences with an associated tag.</p>
				<p><strong>Creating</strong></p>
				<p>For example, let's say we wanted to create a geofence on the server with the tag "demo".</p>
				<p>Geofences have information such as latitude and longitude which define the center of the fence, then a radius value as well. Let's make that now</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/114d81f9192c2dfe745a.js"></script>
        <p>Call</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/7120ff389ce85aeaf23d.js"></script>
        <p>This call will fail if latitude is not between -90 and 90 and longitude is not between -180 and 180.</p>
				<p><strong>Retrieving</strong></p>
				<p>Retrieving a geofence to change it is also similarly easy. You can retrieve beacons by either id (unique) or by tag (array).</p>
				<p>Retrieving by id is as follows:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/a36aaa2d1f898dde4f36.js"></script>
        <p>Retrieving by tag gives you an array of geofences, you have the option of passing in your location to limit the scope to those close to you:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/cfcc84f8ff0d6c6cd5e2.js"></script>
				<p>The location parameter helps to isolate the number of geofences returned by CCHGeofenceService to those within the radius parameter measured in meters sorted by nearest distance</p>
				<p><strong>Updating</strong></p>
				<p>Updating a geofence is a single call</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/738ff4434d8944fed952.js"></script>
        <p><strong>Deleting</strong></p>
				<p>Deleting a geofence is also similar</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/1ef49eb6d0f115117660.js"></script>
        
				<h2  id="event-service">Event Service</h2>
				<h3>Events</h3>
				<p><code>CCHSensorPipeline</code> allows you to tap into the events triggered by changes in state which then flow up to ContextHub for processing. You can listen in on a variety of events including beacon_in, beacon_out, and beacon_changed events, geofence_in and geofence_out events, and then location_changed and motion_changed events. In order to conserve battery, only events which are subscribed to will generate events in ContextHub (with exception of location_changed)</p>
				<p><strong>Protocols</strong></p>
				<p>Set the pipeline delegate and datasource to one of your classes ` [[CCHSensorPipeline sharedInstance] setDataSource:self];` and ` [[CCHSensorPipeline sharedInstance] setDelegate: self];` Conforming to the CCHSensorPipelineDataSource and CCHSensorPipelineDelegate protocols gives you the ability to see and control which events should, will, and have flown up to the ContextHub server as well as send custom event payloads.</p>
				<p><strong>Subscribing</strong></p>
				<p>You then need to subscribe to the tag of the element on the server (beacons, geofences, etc..) to have your app be notified of events:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/c19ae6ac8a4e2a719802.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Observing</strong></p>
				<p>Then, you need to observe the notification so your specific method for handling events can be called:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/c949ae2af8fedfd75c4d.js"></script>
				<p>There are a series of helper class extensions which extend CLBeaconRegion and CLCircularRegion which make processing generated events easier (CLBeaconRegion+ContextHub and CLCircularRegion+ContextHub)</p>
				<p><strong>Responding</strong></p>
				<p>Finally, you'll start getting notifications sent to your method about events. For example, if you had named your method "handleNotification", you would structure your method like this:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/22af2139e6509bdf5835.js"></script>
				<h3>Subscriptions</h3>
				<p><code>CCHSubscriptionService</code> allows you to plug into CRUD notifications of objects located on the ContextHub server. This allows you to respond to state changes instantly instead of constantly polling the ContextHub server for new data, draining the battery. CCHSubscriptionService uses APNS which must be setup in order to receive these messages.</p>
				<p><strong>Subscribing</strong></p>
				<p>First subscribe to the tag which you are interested in on the ContextHub server:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/42d5db5d219cc9bba3f6.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Observing</strong></p>
				<p>Then observe the notification you are interested in using NSNotificationCenter like so:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/c949ae2af8fedfd75c4d.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Responding</strong></p>
				<p>Lastly in your <code>[application: didReceiveRemoteNotification: fetchCompletionHandler:]</code> method, make sure to call </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/2b2cb7409c021d86cc80.js"></script>
        <p>This will allow the ContextHub SDK to process background notifications then notify your app of any changes if they were to happen.</p>
				
				<h2 id="contextual-service">Contextual Service</h2>
				<h3>Contexts</h3>
				<p>The contextual engine evaluates contextual rules written in JavaScript to respond to events triggered by devices and sensors to cause actions which happen on the ContextHub server which affect other devices. These actions include sending push notification, storing data in vault, sending and receiving http requests, and logging console data to your server logs. These actions happen through objects which have a set of methods available to you to create powerful contexts in your applications.</p>
				<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Event</strong></p>
				<p>This object contains the information which triggered the event. Within every event object contains the name, data, payload, and context keys available for you to access.</p>
				<p>Sample event:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/a561eebf2c95acb43c69.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Specifics:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Name - name of the event, which matches one of the available event types</li>
				<li>Data - data for each event matches its event type</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Beacons</strong></p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/4d590d9baa29084edfde.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Changed:</strong></p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/a6915dc76c05adf86d2a.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Geofences In/out:</strong></p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/b056f1eab3712b528d0e.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Location Changed</strong></p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/a059f2277a0620431fe1.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Motion Changed</strong></p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/d97b5608522e8912d641.js"></script>
				<ul>
					<li>Context - The array contains event data for each of the context types that you have used in your contexts on ContextHub.</li>
					<li>Device - info specific to the device which triggered the event</li>
				</ul>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/8856e24cf1564470d52f.js"></script>
				<ul>
					<li>Payload - this is additional data sent by your application in addition to the event data. It is defined as a CCHSensorPipelineDataSource protocol method for you to implement.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Push</strong></p>
				<p>This object allows you to send foreground (with alert messages) and background (without alert messages) push notifications to either devices, aliases, tags or push tokens. Writing rules to send to specific push tokens is discouraged, as a push token has no guarantee of staying the same for the lifetime of an application installation.</p>
				<p><strong>Vault</strong></p>
				<p>This object allows you to store information within the vault directly from a contextual rule. You have the ability to create, retrieve (by id, keypath, and tag), update, and delete vault items.</p>
				<p><strong>HTTP</strong></p>
				<p>This object lets you make HTTP get and post requests within a contextual rule. You have the ability to set parameters and custom headers for your requests, then get back a response and respond accordingly. Note: a contextual rule only has 30 seconds of processing before timing out and these HTTP requests occur synchronously, so be aware that your rule may not be fully executed if waiting for an HTTP request to complete.</p>
				<p><strong>Console</strong></p>
				<p>This object allows you to log messages into your server logs to diagnose potential issues in your contextual rule as well as keep a record of what has occurred.</p>
				<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
				<p>Each rule written is triggered when a specific event type is posted to the ContextHub server from a device and then evaluated. Using the objects listed above, you can create complex rules using JavaScript and trigger events to occur. Rules have 30 seconds to finish processing before they timeout.</p>
				<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
				<p>For example, a simple rule that logs and stores a geofence event in the vault would look like this:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/43d707615ab3f3b5cb8f.js"></script>
				
				<h2 id="application-services">Application Services</h2>
				<h3 id="push">Push Notifications</h3>
				<p>CCHPush deals with registering, sending and receiving push notifications within ContextHub. This is covered in greater detail in the WayFinder v3.0 sample app (including generating private keys and certs)</p>
				<p><strong>Registering</strong></p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/f7e3567823ba985cff1e.js"></script>
				<p>Call to trigger the device to get a push notification token from Apple's servers. This is often called in the <code>[application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]</code> method in your application delegate</p>
				<p>Then in your <code>[application: didRegisterforRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:]</code> method, pass that push token to <code>[[CCHPush sharedInstance] registerDeviceToken: alias: tags: completionHandler:^(NSError *error) {}]</code> method.</p>
				<p>Aliases are a way of abstracting a user's devices to be less dependent on a specific push token (as they may change for a number of reasons). They need not be unique, a common pattern is to hash a user's username or email address so it is the same between multiple devices, and a single push is sent to all a user's devices at once. Do not store personally identifiable information in the alias, salt and hash it to keep it from being easily discoverable.</p>
				<p>Tags are a method of organizing specific groups of devices to have push notifications sent to. Tags are meant to be more general than aliases, as a device can have many tags but only one alias.</p>
				<p>If you need to change the alias or tags for a device, simply call <code>[[CCHPush sharedInstance] registerDeviceToken: alias: tags: completionHandler:^(NSError *error) {}]</code> again to update that info on the server.</p>
				<p>At this point, if everything is working, when your app is launched, a popup will appear asking for permission to accept remote notifications.</p>
				<p><strong>Sending</strong></p>
				<p>You have three options for sending push notifications to other devices: by device id, alias, and tag. Each method accepts an array of identifiers to send a push at once. You need to construct an NSDictionary that has at least the alert key set with your message in order to be delivered with a visible notification. Other optional keys include sound and badge, which let you set what sound to play or badge number to set. Content-available is another key that allows you to set whether a message should be sent in the background as a silent notification which will not alert the user so your app can process data in the background. Here are the methods you can use:</p>
				<p>To device(s)</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/fba5b225958b15102908.js"></script>
				<p>To alias(es)</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/597008f760d801a7a60e.js"></script>
				<p>To tag(s)</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/5441ae0e39e9a2cb50d4.js"></script>
				<p>Apple push notification services makes a best effort to deliver the message to a device, however there is no guarantee in delivery. Silent notifications often piggyback on other foreground notifications before they are delivered, so during testing, they may not be received immediately.</p>
				<p><strong>Receiving</strong></p>
				<p>Receiving and responding to push notifications happens with a simple method implemented in your application delegate: <code>[application: didReceiveRemoteNotification: fetchCompletionHandler:]</code></p>
				<p>Call <code>[[CCHPush sharedInstance] application: didReceiveRemoteNotification: completionHandler: {}]</code> on all remote notifications. Within the completion handler, you can put your own code in to process notifications that are <em>not</em> from ContextHub. Be sure to still call the completionHandler with either UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData/NoData/Failed method so iOS knows how often to launch your app in the background for processing.</p>
				<h3 id="vault">Vault</h3>
				<p><code>CCHVault</code> allows you persist important information so it can live on the ContextHub server. You have the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) vault items with an associated tag.</p>
				<p><strong>Creating</strong></p>
				<p>For example, let's say we wanted to store a bit of extra information about a beacon. We would store the UUID, major and minor which unique identifies the beacon, plus its associated data in an NSDictionary to be sent up to the server.</p>
				<p>Our sample dictionary item:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/66d710b2e0d26181f555.js"></script>
				<p>Then create that item on the server:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/49b920d934cf5b678cba.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Retrieving</strong></p>
				<p>Retrieving a vault item to change it is also similarly easy. You can retrieve beacons by either id (unique) or by tag (array).</p>
				<p>Retrieval by id:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/3aefa9607cd8b76f2c26.js"></script>
				<p>Retrieval by tag:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/9c68a1552b57202c72cf.js"></script>
				<p>completionHandler:^(NSArray *responses, NSError *error) {}];</p>
				<p><strong>Updating</strong></p>
				<p>Updating a vault item is a single call</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kevinwlee/bbd87069f922eb549b91.js"></script>
				<p><strong>Deleting</strong></p>
				<p>Deleting a vault item is also similar</p>

        <p>WayFinder is the product of a ContextHub hackathon we held at ChaiOne in March 2014. It uses bluetooth beacons to help newcomers to our Houston location get a tour of the office right on their device. Each time they reach a beacon, they get interesting facts about the company, or info about some of our more recent projects.</p>
        <p>The reason we chose this project for the ContextHub hackathon is because normally this would be a pretty intense undertaking for a hackathon. However, thanks to the simplicity ContextHub provides, the WayFinder team was able to produce this fully functioning, beacon powered application in no time.</p>
